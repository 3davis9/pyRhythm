**TO DO**

~~-note movement based on song position~~

-data struct for song data/beatmap and interpreter- maybe json file?

~~-implement 4 tracks. prob 3 more queues and all initialized notes go in the note sprite group~~

-menu screen, ability to select level

-popup text for hits and misses (possibly a hit and miss method to handle game events based on such)

-more variation than hit or miss (ex. good, excelent)

-score counter

-health bar for monster

-art for monster, knight, and background (working on this -aja)

-song and beatmap
