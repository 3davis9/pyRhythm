**TO DO**

-data struct for song data/beatmap and interpreter- maybe json file?

-OR song and beatmap (at least hard-coded)

-menu screen, ability to select level

-game over/game won screen

-more variation than hit or miss (ex. good, excelent)

-score counter(working on this -Anshul)

-health bar for monster - Done

- art for health bar - could use the same art as pads with different color and more width

-~~art for monster, knight, and background~~ depleted health version of monster (working on this -aja)

-cloud animations to signify damage being taken

~~-note movement based on song position~~

~~-implement 4 tracks. prob 3 more queues and all initialized notes go in the note sprite group~~

-~~popup text for hits and misses (possibly a hit and miss method to handle game events based on such)~~
